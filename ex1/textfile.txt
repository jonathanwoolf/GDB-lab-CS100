1. src and dst before delete hold the value "hello". After it deletes, they hold "hello" and "" respectively. 
2. There is no terminating character ('\0') at the end of dst after the copy is complete. 
3. We can fix this by setting the dstArr to 0 before deleting. Then changing delete to delete[], and adding a terminating character to the end of dst.
